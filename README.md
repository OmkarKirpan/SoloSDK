## Solo SDK -  CocoaPod
This git repo is for users of the Solo SDK framework who wish to obtain the latest
framework through CocoaPods. The Guide PDF can be used to setup a new project however
it is strongly recommended to download our SDK together with the sample application
from [camerai.co](camerai.co).


## Downloadable Resources
If you require face tracking then you can find the Data resources [here](https://github.com/tipitltd/SoloSDK/blob/master/Resources/Data).

The current model which can be used with our SDK is [here](https://github.com/tipitltd/SoloSDK/tree/master/Resources/Models)

You can now use [Camerai Studio](https://camerai.co/studio) to create your own effects and use them with our SDK

Many changes coming soon. Stay tuned!
